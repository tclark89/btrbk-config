# Directory in which the btrfs snapshots are created. Relative to

# If not set, the snapshots are created in <volume-directory>.
#
# If you want to set a custom name for the snapshot (and backups),
# use the "snapshot_name" option within the subvolume section.
#
# NOTE: btrbk does not automatically create this directory, and the
# snapshot creation will fail if it is not present.

#snapshot_dir               _btrbk_snap

# Always create snapshots. Set this to "ondemand" to only create
# snapshots if the target volume is reachable. Set this to "no" if
# snapshot creation is done by another instance of btrbk.

# Perform incremental backups (set to "strict" if you want to prevent

# Enable lock file support: Ensures that only one instance of btrbk
# can be run at a time.
#lockfile                   /var/lock/btrbk.lock

# Don't wait for transaction commit on deletion. Enable this to make

#
# Volume section (optional): "volume <volume-directory>"
#
#   <volume-directory>  Base path within a btrfs filesystem
#                       containing the subvolumes to be backuped
#                       (usually the mount-point of a btrfs filesystem
#                       mounted with subvolid=5 option).
#
# Subvolume section: "subvolume <subvolume-name>"
#
#   <subvolume-name>    Subvolume to be backuped, relative to
#                       <volume-directory> in volume section.
#
# Target section: "target <type> <volume-directory>"
#
#   <type>              (optional) type, defaults to "send-receive".
#   <volume-directory>  Directory within a btrfs filesystem
#                       receiving the backups.
#
# NOTE: The parser does not care about indentation, this is only for
# human readability. All options apply to the last section
# encountered, overriding the corresponding option of the upper
# section. This means that the global options must be set on top,
# before any "volume", "subvolume" or "target section.
